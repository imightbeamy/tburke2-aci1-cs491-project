DuBois and Flanigan investigate the possibilities of the improvised voice in tandem with electroacoustic processing. The interplay between the two performers (one singing, one processing) engages the metaphor of the voice as impulse and the computer as filter, creating a dense palette of evocative sounds and images derived entirely from the voice of the singer. Using custom software written by DuBois, Flanigan\\u2019s voice is restructured live and in real time through spectral processing. While the two performers partake in a \\u201cdialogue\\u201d of sounds and words, the changing shape of the voice is traced visually through live video, leaving trails that evoke the memory of voice.
